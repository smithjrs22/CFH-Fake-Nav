    <h1>Christmas is my favorite season</h1>
    <p>My mom's birthday is on December 29th. I <strong>always</strong> enjoy the Christmas music.</p>
    <h2>Green is my favorite color</h2>
    <p>I love the color <b>green</b> because money is green. <i>Just kidding.</i> I just like green colors but don't like to drink green drinks.
